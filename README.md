# MiSTer Unused Core Folder Remover
MiSTer unused core folder remover
Each time I update, it recreates all the core folders eventhough I filtered some cores out so I decided to create a small script to clean those up. Its not much but enjoy.

Usage: Edit the script and change de UNUSED variable to add the core folder you wish to clean.

Even though I tried to make it as secure as possible, use at your own risk.
